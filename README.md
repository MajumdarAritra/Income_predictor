# Income_predictor<br>
# Overview<br>
The Income Predictor project uses the Decision Tree algorithm to predict an individual's income category based on various demographic and socio-economic features. This machine learning model classifies data into income brackets, helping organizations make informed decisions.<br>

# Features<br>
Predict income category (e.g., <=50K or >50K) using the Decision Tree algorithm.<br>
Comprehensive data preprocessing including handling missing values and feature encoding.<br>
Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.<br>
Visualization of the decision tree for interpretability.
